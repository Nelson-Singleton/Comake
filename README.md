# Comake

While attending Lambda school, designed, with the assistance of my team, a small project by the name of Comake. We intended for Comake to be a small social media platform that
would allow community members to create posts highlighting the issues in their communities that needed tending to- allowing local government and problem solvers to more 
easily collaborate with their communities.

After creating a basic prototype at Lambda school, I've redesigned Comake, and am currently using the project to learn the MERN stack and sass/less/material UI.
Comake is currently a work in progress, but I plan to add new features over time. I find that the idea could be incredibly valuable to communities in my city,
and I'm passionate about turning it into a useful application.

Technologies used:

HTML/CSS/JS/Material UI
Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, React
Axios, React-Date-Picker

Current Todo list:
1. Add the ability to edit and delete posts.
2. Add the ability to add comments to posts.
3. Develop upvote count functionality.
4. Implement user authentication via OAuth or another solution.
5. Implement password hashing via bcrypt.
6. Develop registration process for organizations, and allow users to create profiles.
7. Add a geolocation feature allowing users to choose a community based on their zip code.
